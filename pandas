Pandas gives you R dataframe like objects in python. It's great for munging data about.

I like to install pandas from source since there are bugs still but the developers are awesome and fast to deal with them.

# Requirements

## Easy Ones
Here are some dependencies that I don't care about having the newest version of:
sudo pip install python-dateutil
sudo pip install pytz

# Numexpr
Numexpr is a very cool library that does smart things wrt keeping operations on arrays working out of cache.

wget https://numexpr.googlecode.com/files/numexpr-2.0.1.tar.gz

# Cython
Allows writing c extensions in python. Used to build the dev version. And it's just really cool.
wget http://cython.org/release/Cython-0.18.tar.gz
