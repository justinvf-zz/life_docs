Making an ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "justinvf@gmail.com"

ssh-ing using a specific public key
ssh -i /path/to/key foo@bar

ssh-ing with x compressed x forwarding
ssh -XC foo@bar

ssh-ing to a host on the local network:
add .local after the hostname. This uses mDNS. Might not work in all environments.
