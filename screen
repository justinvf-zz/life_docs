Screen should be used for all long running things that you do on a remote host.

After sshing

screen -S <name of thing you are working on>

Once in screen Ctrl-a starts you off with a command. This drives me nuts in emacs so I usually don't do text editing in screen.

Ctrl-a d: Will detach you from the session. Logout if you want. Stuff will keep running fine.

screen -ls: Will show you what sessions are running. This is why you should pass "-S <name>" when starting screen.
screen -r <name of session>: Will re-attach you to the session. If you didn't name the session, just type the pid from `screen -ls`.
Ctrl-a c: Make a window from within screen.
Ctrl-a n/p: Go to the next/previous window
